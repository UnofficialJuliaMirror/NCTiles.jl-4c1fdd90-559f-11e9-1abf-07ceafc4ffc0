# NCTiles.jl Documentation

**NCTiles.jl** is intended to write, read, etc. tiled `Netcdf` files as often done in global ocean and climate modeling. Inter-operability with various global grids and [MeshArrays.jl](https://github.com/gaelforget/MeshArrays.jl) is an important prospect of this package. It is inspired from an earlier implementation as part of the [gcmfaces](https://github.com/gaelforget/gcmfaces) toolbox ([Forget et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3071-2015>)).
